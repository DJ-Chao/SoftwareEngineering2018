For the design process, I added a second rail line and subsequently a second train which would, instead of moving east to west like the original train, move west to east.  This design mimicked the design of the previous track and train, adding the two gates currently in use as observers of the new rail that was located below the previous rail/train.  I am sure many people feel this same way, but I do not particularly enjoy working with other peopleâ€™s code: it seems to be a bit more difficult for me to try and piece together what someone else has done, especially when I was not there for the actual genesis of the code (i.e. not being able to work through the thought process of the author in the same way that they did seemed to be a hindrance to me). I would certainly like to improve upon my car design (I was not able to properly implement a working solution for the cars to have a state change and move across the meridian, and the solution I developed actually degraded the train movement and gate recognition, so I needed to revert to a code state before those changes) as well as a few issues with the new track (the train movement was awkward and buggy initially, an issue which had to be worked around with more hardcoded numbers than I would have liked).
With this in mind, I do not think that my model would scale particularly well: it is very obviously still full of bugs, as well as the issues with the cars.  Since the cars changing lanes degraded the railway recognition system, it would not scale well to include, say, a real-time monitoring system of multiple stops for the railway, or a simulation of actual daily traffic (since the car movement was not properly implemented fully on my behalf).
