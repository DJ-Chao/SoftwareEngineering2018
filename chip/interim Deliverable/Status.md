As of now, a simple grid is all that is functionally complete.  I am currently working on implementing chip so that he 
can appropriately move around, as well as working on a sand block: the next logical steps from here would be to test 
sandblock and add necessary code to have it interact properly when it would hit a water tile.  The plan from here would 
be to implement the bug and key classes in either order, and once these are all ultimately in place and working properly, 
I will move on to designing the level structure via the interace and then wrap up the project from there
